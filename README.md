<h1>Where's the Throw?</h1>

This project exists because it is hard and time-consuming to teach the rules and strategies of baseball to little-leaguers. "Where's the Throw?" gamifies the process of learning baseball plays to create a fun and streamlined introduction to the sport.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

1. Download Unity from [here](https://unity.com/download). Follow the instructions for your operating system.

    <code>git clone https://github.com/WhereIsTheThrow/WhereIsTheThrow.git [folder] </code>

2. In the Unity Hub Projects tab, click "Add" and select the folder you just cloned into.

3. Now that the project is listed in your Projects tab, click on the project to open it. It is now ready to begin development.

<h2>Testing</h2>

In the Unity Editor, select Window -> General -> Test Runner to open the test window. Click "Run All" or "Run Selected" to run all or some of the tests.

<h2>Deployment</h2>

Deployment is done through the App Store and managed with our developer account, to which new contributors will need to request access by contacting current developers.

Pre-production beta testing is done via TestFlight.

The app is entirely packaged within the Unity project file and XCode build.

There is no continuous deployment. Per Apple requirements, to publish updates the app must be rebuilt to XCode, uploaded to the developer account, and submitted for review.


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

Unity and Firebase.

The ADRs live in the base folder of the main branch of the GitHub repo.

<h2>Contributing</h2>

A new developer will need access to the GitHub repository and to the Apple developer account to be able to publish any contributions.

There are no special style, testing, or process conventions that a new developer should be aware of.

See the project [website](https://tarheels.live/whereistheplay/) for more information.
